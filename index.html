        <p>I switched hosts and am having a few issues. I'll fix it when I get the time/cba (getting things working is really pissing me off), so the archive search will be down for a bit :(</p>
        <p>Guide for an alternative method to find Sandbox games: <a href="http://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/GameMaker_Sandbox#Using_the_Wayback_Machine">wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/GameMaker_Sandbox#Using_the_Wayback_Machine</a></p>
        <p>Remember you can host your own Sandbox search! Source is at <a href="https://github.com/honno/yygarchive.org">github.com/honno/yygarchive.org</a>.</p>
        <p>If 1) I know you 2) you're good with hosting things on headless linux machines or whatever 3) want to help me out here, hit me up!</p>
